# 100 Days of Making - Generative Design

This project aims daily iteration of creative process and I chose exploring generative design and TouchDesigner's world for 100 days and even more. This interest began with my past exploration of Processing, openFrameworks and Max/MSP and inspired by a book called Generative Gesutaltung, I've decided to focus my challenge on building a solid skill set on which to carry forward after ITP.
